# Data In Control!

Generic functionality detected and applied by using data attributes on DOM elements. The advantage of using data attributes instead of using classes and/or ids to extend elements with some functionality is that we can provide values with the property.

F.i., if you'd like to toggle a box's visibility you would have to give the trigger a class of .toggler and set its target manually in the markup. This way we get a selector together with a target, a value or whatever.

## Examples:

<div data-toggle-on-click=".toggle-content" data-toggle-classes="folded unfolded">Toggle some content somewhere</div>
